# Hi there 👋 I'm Matías Figueroa

**Analista Programador (INACAP) | Full Stack Developer & Systems Engineering Enthusiast**

I am a software developer focused on the bridge between high-level web applications and low-level system performance. My background as an *Analista Programador* gives me a strong foundation in logic, which I am currently applying to master Rust and Infrastructure.

### 🔭 Currently Working On
* **Web Performance:** Building prototypes on Vercel using **Next.js** and **React**.
* **Systems Foundations:** Transitioning from **C** to **Rust** to understand memory safety and high-performance computing.
* **Enterprise Logic:** Exploring **ABAP** to understand the architecture behind large-scale corporate systems.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** ReactJS, Next.js.
* **Backend:** PHP (Laravel), Python (Django), JavaScript (Node.js).
* **Systems:** C (Foundations), Rust (In Progress).

### 🌱 2026 Goals
* Build a high-performance backend infrastructure using **Rust**.
* Deepen my understanding of **WebAssembly (WASM)**.
* Master enterprise resource management through **ABAP**.
